This Thesis describes the Architecture of a highly flexible Triplestore Framework. 
Its main features are: pluggable backend storage facilities, horizontal Scalability, a simple API and  the generation of endless result Streams.
Special attention has been paid on easy extensibility. 
First a detailed view of the architecture is given, later more details on the actual implementation are revealed.
In the end two possible triplestore setups are benchmarked and profiled. 
It is shown that the currently limiting factors do not lie within the architecture but in the library code for the backends. 
In the end possible solutions and enhancements to the framework are discussed.
